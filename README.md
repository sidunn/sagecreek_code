MEAN tutorial files for "mean-news3"

These are files I have created and modified while studying the MEAN stack tutorial from http://thinkster.io/mean-stack-tutorial.
The Thinkster project name is "flapperNews." The name I am using, "mean-news3" refers to the fact that it took me two previous tries to get the code put together correctly! I learned a lot about the MEAN stack by working the tutorial all the way to its conclusion.
